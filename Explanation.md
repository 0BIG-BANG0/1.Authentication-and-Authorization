✅ Concepts You've Covered
🔹 1. Project Setup
ES Modules ("type": "module" in package.json)

Organized folder structure: routes, controller, service, model, middleware, db

Use of dotenv for environment variables

🔹 2. Node.js & Express Fundamentals
Setting up a basic Express server

Using express.json() middleware for body parsing

Routing using express.Router()

Understanding and using controller-service structure

🔹 3. MongoDB & Mongoose
Connecting to MongoDB using mongoose

Singleton pattern for DB connection (to avoid reconnecting)

Defining mongoose.Schema and creating models

Mongoose methods: findOne, create, find, timestamps, unique fields, and validations

🔹 4. User Registration Flow
Handling POST /register

Input validation (basic — required, min/max, email format)

Checking if user already exists before creating

Sending proper response messages

Good error handling patterns (using try/catch, descriptive errors)

🔹 5. Password Security
Hashing passwords using bcrypt

Verifying passwords using bcrypt.compare()

Ensuring sensitive data (like hashed password) is not returned in responses

🔹 6. User Login Flow
POST /login flow

Validating email and password combo

Secure error messages (generic "Invalid email or password")

Returning a cleaned-up user object (safe fields only)

🔹 7. JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
Generating JWT on login with jsonwebtoken

Using jwt.sign() with expiry time (expiresIn)

Protecting routes using middleware

Verifying token with jwt.verify()

Extracting token from Authorization header (Bearer <token>)

Attaching decoded payload (req.user) for downstream use

🔹 8. Testing & Debugging
Using Postman to test your endpoints

Sending headers and tokens correctly

Interpreting error messages

Debugging with console.log

🔹 9. Middleware Concept
Writing custom middleware (jwtAuth)

Understanding middleware chaining with next()

Error handling inside middleware

🚀 Bonus: Development Environment Skills
Using NVM to switch Node versions

Setting up and fixing .env and path-related issues

Using nodemon for hot-reloading
